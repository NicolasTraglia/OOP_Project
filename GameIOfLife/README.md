Object-Oriented Programming project Game of Life.

Description
This project aims to re-create the program invented by John Conway. It is initially composed of 3 rules:

Living cell with fewer than 2 "alive" (=1 cell value) neighboring cell (neighbors) "dies" (cell value is set to 0).
Living cell with strictly more than 3 alive neighbors dies.
Dead cell with 3 alive neighbors "is born" (cell value set to 1).
The project required us to only edit the Simulator.java file in backend.

TODO/ONGOING ISSUES:
Work on the "to go further"
ideas: more than just 0 or 1 cell values and additional mechanics.

Contact either collaborators if you encounter any issues.
